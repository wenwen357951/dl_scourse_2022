# Deep Learning (Short Course 2022 at STUTS, Taiwan) 

This course in deep learning focuses on practical aspects of deep learning. We therefore use jupyter notebooks, in the course. 

For doing the hands-on part, we recommend to use colab (you might need a google account) an internet connections is needed. If you want to do it without internet connection on your own computer you can either install anaconda ([details and installation instruction](anaconda.md)) or use the provided a docker container ([details and installation instruction](docker.md)).

To easily follow the course please make sure that you are familiar with the some [basic math and python skills](prerequistites.md). 

## Info for the projects
You can join together in small groups (maximum 3 students) and choose a topic for your DL project. You should prepare a poster and a spotlight talk (5 minutes) which you will present on the last course day. The poster does not need to be fancy, a few printed out pages are fine too.

## Other resources 
This course a short version of a to several courses given together with Beate Sick for the CAS Deep Learning at the ZHAW in Winterthur (8 times 4 hours) [link](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course_2022) and a version with R (instead of python) given together we Beate Sick for the WBL at the ETH Zurich [link](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_rcourse_2022). 

* Probabilistic Deep Learning (DL-Book) [Probabilistic Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/probabilistic-deep-learning?a_aid=probabilistic_deep_learning&a_bid=78e55885). This book is by the tensorchiefs and covers the increasingly popular probabilistic approach to deep learning.

* Deep Learning Book (DL-Book) [http://www.deeplearningbook.org/](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). This is a quite comprehensive book which goes far beyond the scope of this course. 

* Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition [http://cs231n.stanford.edu/](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), has additional material and [youtube videos of the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC). While the focus is on computer vision, it also treats other topics such as optimization, backpropagation and RNNs. Lecture notes can be found at [http://cs231n.github.io/](http://cs231n.github.io/).
